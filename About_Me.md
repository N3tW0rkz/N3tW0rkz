- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **@N3tW0rkz**
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in **game development and engineering**, exploring how technology can create immersive experiences.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Python** after finishing **C++, HTML, and JavaScript**, aiming to build my skills in programming, and hardware development..
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: **He/Him**
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've spent countless hours (**and way too many cups of coffee**) sitting in my chair, determined to squash those annoying bugs in my code. It often feels like Iâ€™m in a battle of patience with my own computer!
